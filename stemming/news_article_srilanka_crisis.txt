Ahead of new Cabinet’s swearing in today, troops raided Lanka’s main protest site, assaulted protesters and media
Dinesh Gunewardena took oath as the new Prime Minister of Sri Lanka on Friday. A stalwart of Sri Lankan politics, Gunewardena, earlier also served as the foreign minister and education minister. He was appointed as Home Minister in April by then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is also set to swear in his Cabinet on Friday comprising members of the previous government.

Ahead of the swearing in of the new Cabinet, a huge military contingent, along with police, raided Galle Face in Colombo early on Friday, where anti-government protesters have peacefully agitated for over three months in the wake of the island nation’s grave economic crisis. Several protesters were assaulted by soldiers, according to eyewitnesses.
